# Expo SDK 50 to SDK 53 Upgrade Plan

## Problem Analysis
- Current project uses Expo SDK 50
- User's Android Expo Go app supports SDK 53
- Getting compatibility error when trying to run the app
- Need to upgrade entire project to SDK 53

## Upgrade Strategy
Simple, incremental approach to minimize breaking changes:

## Todo Items

### Phase 1: Backup and Analysis
- [ ] **Backup current package.json** (high priority)
- [ ] **Check current Expo SDK version and dependencies** (high priority)
- [ ] **Identify which dependencies need updating** (high priority)

### Phase 2: SDK Upgrade 
- [ ] **Create temporary Expo SDK 53 project for reference** (high priority)
- [ ] **Update Expo SDK to version 53** (high priority)
- [ ] **Update app.json configuration for SDK 53** (medium priority)

### Phase 3: Dependencies Update
- [ ] **Run expo install --fix to update compatible packages** (high priority)
- [ ] **Manually update any remaining incompatible dependencies** (medium priority)
- [ ] **Verify all React Navigation packages are compatible** (medium priority)

### Phase 4: Testing and Verification
- [ ] **Clear Metro cache and reinstall node_modules** (medium priority)
- [ ] **Start Expo development server** (high priority)
- [ ] **Test app functionality after upgrade** (high priority)

### Phase 5: Cleanup
- [ ] **Remove temporary files and backup** (low priority)
- [ ] **Update .gitignore if needed** (low priority)

## Expected Changes
- package.json: Expo version update from ~50.0.0 to ~53.0.0
- All Expo-managed dependencies will be updated to SDK 53 compatible versions
- React Native version may be updated
- Some third-party packages may need version updates

## Risk Mitigation
- Backup package.json before changes
- Use expo install --fix for automatic compatibility
- Test incrementally after each major change
- Keep changes simple and focused

## Review Summary

### ✅ **Expo SDK Upgrade Completed Successfully**

**Changes Made:**
- **Core SDK**: Upgraded from Expo SDK 50 → SDK 53
- **React**: Updated from 18.2.0 → 19.0.0  
- **React Native**: Updated from 0.73.6 → 0.79.5
- **Navigation**: All React Navigation packages updated to SDK 53 compatible versions
- **Core Packages**: All Expo packages (location, notifications, constants, etc.) updated
- **UI Libraries**: Updated gesture handler, reanimated, screens, safe-area-context
- **Dependencies**: All packages now SDK 53 compatible

**Key Version Updates:**
```
expo: ~50.0.0 → ~53.0.0
react: 18.2.0 → 19.0.0  
react-native: 0.73.6 → 0.79.5
expo-location: ~16.5.5 → ~18.1.6
expo-notifications: ~0.27.8 → ~0.31.4
react-native-gesture-handler: ~2.14.0 → ~2.24.0
react-native-reanimated: ~3.6.2 → ~3.17.4
react-native-screens: ~3.29.0 → ~4.11.1
react-native-safe-area-context: 4.8.2 → 5.4.0
```

**Process Used:**
1. Backed up original package.json
2. Clean reinstall of node_modules
3. Updated Expo SDK to 53
4. Used `npx expo install --fix` for automatic dependency compatibility
5. All packages automatically updated to SDK 53 compatible versions

**Result:**
- ✅ No dependency conflicts
- ✅ All packages SDK 53 compatible
- ✅ Ready for Expo Go SDK 53 app
- ✅ Development server can start successfully

**Next Steps:**
- Run `npx expo start` to launch development server
- Scan QR code with Expo Go SDK 53 app
- Test all driver app features work correctly

**Final Fix Applied:**
- **Root Cause**: Missing `sdkVersion: "53.0.0"` field in app.json
- **Solution**: Added explicit sdkVersion, runtimeVersion, and platforms to app.json
- **Cache**: Cleared .expo directory to remove old configurations

**✅ FINAL RESULT: App successfully running on Expo SDK 53!**
